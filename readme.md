This is my personal notebook of what little Python I have learnt. This started initially as some notes/cheatsheet for data analysis using Python. It somehow progressed, rather progressing, into a Python guide for beginners.

If you found this humble attempt helpful, I am glad to have helped you out!

This notebook largely contains my learnings from:
