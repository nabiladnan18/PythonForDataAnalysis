    "In the example above, you can also notice another thing going on. The `draw` method is being called on two different objects that are in no way related to each other. This is because Python does not care, nor does it check the type of the object on which the `draw` method is being called. It merely checks whether a method called `draw` exists for that object and calls it. This is called **Duck Typing**. It comes from the phrase: “If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck.” This philosophy focuses on what something can do, rather than what it is."
